Let's talk about music!

The first part will cover some concepts, which I will try to whip-though, so we can get to the algorithms.

These slides are live at my github link on the bottom of each page, if you want to follow along or reread what just happened.

This presentation used to have a bunch more words - concepts, descriptions, types, and techniques, etc.

But it took way too long before getting to the algorithms!

=head1 Why Make Algorithmic Music?

=over

=item *

Creation in and of itself!

=item *

To make fragments for a larger context

=item *

To satisfy curiosities

=item *

For practice and study, with etudes and rhythms

=back

=end note

=head1 Fundamental Questions

=over

=item *

How do you construct a rhythm?

=item *

How do you generate pleasing harmony?

=item *

How do you make a melody?

=item *

How do you structure a tune?

=over

=item ALL GOOD QUESTIONS!!1!

=back

=back

=begin note

These are the questions we will have to answer if we want to create algorithmic music that follows traditional theory.

If we don't care about traditions, then anything goes (and MIDI is probably not your thing)!

The idea of phrase development itself is controversial. E.g. Brian Eno, Primus guitar.

There are as many answers as there are musicians. (And there are more ways to make algorithmic music than there are programmers.)
