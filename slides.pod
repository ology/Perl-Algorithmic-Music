=begin note

Let's talk about music!

The first part will cover often overlapping concepts.

I will skip the deep dive into types and techniques of algorithmic music, so we can get to the meat of the matter:

Which is the second part: Examples of actual algorithms.

Also, these slides are live at the link on the bottom of the pages.

=head1 What this talk is NOT about:

=over

=item *

Song / audio analysis

=item *

Real-time audio / MIDI processing

Procedural algorithms

=item *

High-level, OO MIDI score construction

=item *

Writing MIDI files

=item *

Applied music theory

=back

=begin note

Because algorithmic music "exercises" a theory.

=end note

=head1 What is Algorithmic Music?

=head4 Computer-assisted composition where algorithms are used to create musical material.

=over

=item *

For musical creations in and of themselves

=item *

To generate musical ideas and satisfy curiosity

=item *

For practice and study, with rhythms (i.e. a better metronome) and etudes

=item *

To make fragments to import into a larger context - possibly with a DAW ("digital audio workstation")

=back

=begin note

Like Reaper, Ableton, or Apple Logic, etc.

=end note

=head1 What is Algorithmic Music?

=over

=item *

Constructed with mathematical equations or grammars

=item *

Or randomized selection of notes, rhythms, and phrases

=item *

Or probabality logic to determine selection

=item *

Or stochastic processes

=item *

Or rule-based methods

=back

=begin note

=end note

=head1 Types of Algorithmic Music

=head4 "Generative"

=over

=item *

Term popularized by Brian Eno to describe music that is ever-different, changing, and created by a system

=item *

Algorithms that can create different versions of the same musical elements

=back

=begin note

SKIP

=end note

=head1 Types of Algorithmic Music

=head4 Rule-Based

=over

=item *

Uses grammars to generate compositions

=back

=head4 Variation

=over

=item *

Changing pitch, rhythm, or timbre of a phrase, also adding or removing elements

=back

=head4 Transformation

=over

=item *

Manipulating small details of a composition to create new, unique pieces of music

=back

=begin note

SKIP

=end note

=head1 Techniques for Rule-Based Music

=head4 Musical Grammars

=over

=item *

Structured sequences are created by creating a set of rules that determine which rhythms, notes, or phrases are chosen

=back

=head4 Constraints

=over

=item *

A constraint solver searches for solutions, where variables are bound to values of its domain without violating any constraints

=back

=begin note

SKIP

=end note

=head1 Techniques for Statistical Music

=head4 Randomness

=over

=item *

Random sequences are created by randomly choosing notes from a pool of possibilities

=back

=head4 Probability

=over

=item *

By changing the probabilities of rhythms, notes, chords, or phrases, different variations of a musical sequence can be created

=back

=back

=begin note

SKIP

=end note

=head1 A Little Music Theory

=over

=item *

Basic elements: rhythm, harmony, and melody

=item *

Compositional elements: song form, tempo, meter, key signatures, intervals, scales, etc.

=item *

Qualities such as pitch, tone, timbre, texture, dynamics, etc.

=item *

A "motif" is a brief melodic or rhythmic formula out of which longer passages are developed

=back

=begin note

Other than dynamics and possibly texture, these qualities are not easily achieved with MIDI.

This (motif) term will be important later.

The concept of "development" is controversial. Some music doesn't develop phrases at all.

=end note

=head1 Fundamental Questions

=over

=item *

How do you construct a rhythm?

=item *

How do you generate pleasing harmony?

=item *

How do you make a melody?

=item *

How do you structure a tune?

=back

=begin note

These are the questions we will have to answer if we want to create algorithmic music that follows traditional theory.

If we don't care about traditions, then anything goes!

The linked ones are those mentioned in this presentation.

=head1 Basic Algorithms 1 of 2

=begin perl

use MIDI::Util qw(setup_score);

my $score = setup_score();

$score->synch(
    sub { bass($score) },
    sub { treble($score) },
);

$score->write_score("$0.mid");

=end perl

=begin note

The following set of slides are complete programs.

This first one shows the score and synchronization.

=end note

=head1 Basic Algorithms 2 of 2

=begin perl

sub bass {
    my ($score) = @_;
    for my $note (qw(C3 F3 G3 C4)) {
        $score->n('hn', $note);
    }
}
sub treble {
    my ($score) = @_;
    for my $note (qw(C4 D4 E4 F4)) {
        $score->n('qn', $note);
        $score->r('qn');
    }
}

=end perl

=begin note

This slide shows the sychornized parts.

Here we use literal notes with octaves.

Also this is the "proper" way to do things, in terms of CS. But...

=end note

=head1 Basic Algorithms 1 of 3

=begin perl

use MIDI::Util qw(setup_score set_chan_patch);
use Music::Scales qw(get_scale_MIDI);

my $score = setup_score(bpm => 120, volume => 120);

$score->synch(\&bass, \&treble);

$score->write_score("$0.mid");

=end perl

=begin note

Here we use filthy global variables! I'll be sad if you leave now though.

Music programs are not "mission critical."

And they are not "time-sensitive" either. The code just creates MIDI files, rather than real-time processing.

Anyway, here we show the Music::Scales module and show score settings.

=end note

=head1 Basic Algorithms 2 of 3

=begin perl

sub bass {
    set_chan_patch($score, 0, 35);

    my @pitches = get_scale_MIDI('C', 2, 'pentatonic');

    for my $n (1 .. 4) {
        my $pitch = $pitches[int rand @pitches];
        $score->n('hn', $pitch);
    }
}

=end perl

=begin note

And here is the bass part.

First we change to the fretless bass patch on channel zero and get the scale pitches in a non-clashing scale.

Next we add four random pitches to the score, for a half-note each.

=end note

=head1 Basic Algorithms 3 of 3

=begin perl

sub treble {
    set_chan_patch($score, 1, 0);
    my @pitches = (
        get_scale_MIDI('C', 4, 'major'),
        get_scale_MIDI('C', 5, 'major'),
    );

    for my $n (1 .. 4) {
        my $pitch = $pitches[int rand @pitches];
        $score->n('qn', $pitch);
        $score->r('qn');
    }
}

=end perl

=begin note

And here is the treble part. It uses a scale of two octaves, as opposed to the one of the previous bass routine.

And instead of half-notes, we add a quarter pitched note and a quarter-note rest.

=end note

=head1 Basic Algorithms 1 of 2

=begin perl

use Data::Dumper::Compact qw(ddc);
use MIDI::Util qw(setup_score midi_format);
use Music::Chord::Note ();

my $score = setup_score();

my $mcn = Music::Chord::Note->new;

=end perl

=begin note

This slide just introduces the next slide.

But we instantiate our new chord to note list object first.

=end note

=head1 Basic Algorithms 2 of 2

=begin perl

for my $c (qw(Cm7 F7 BbM7 EbM7 Adim7 D7 Gm)) {
    my @chord = $mcn->chord_with_octave($c, 4);

    @chord = midi_format(@chord);
    print ddc(\@chord);

    $score->n('wn', @chord);
}

$score->write_score("$0.mid");

=end perl

=begin note

Here is the meat of the algorithm: Play a list of named chords held for a whole note each.

=end note

=head1 GrooveTool

=head1 Instantiate a Drummer

=begin perl

my $d = MIDI::Drummer::Tiny->new(
    file   => $filename,
    bars   => 4 * $repeat,
    bpm    => $bpm,
    reverb => $reverb,
    volume => $volume,
    # etc...
);

=end perl

=begin note

Everything you need to add drums to a MIDI score and more.

For the GrooveTool, combinatorial patterns are "juxtaposed" = beats!

=end note

=head1 Drummer Decisions

=begin perl

if ($part->{style} eq 'euclid') {
    push @phrases, sub { $self->euclidean_part($part, $key) };
}
elsif ($part->{style} eq 'christoffel') {
    push @phrases, sub { $self->christoffel_part($part, $key) };
}
elsif ($part->{style} eq 'pfold') {
    push @phrases, sub { $self->pfold_part($part, $key) };
}

=end perl

=begin note

Where the $key is a unique phrase identifier.

=head1 Figured Bass Part 1 of 2

=begin perl

    pool    => [qw(hn dqn qn en)],
    weights => [    1,  1, 2, 2 ],
    groups  => [    1,  1, 1, 2 ],

my $voice = Music::VoiceGen->new(
    pitches   => \@pitches,
    intervals => [qw/-4 -3 -2 2 3 4/],

);

my @notes1 = map { $voice->rand } $motifs[0]->@*;
my @notes2 = map { $voice->rand } $motifs[1]->@*;
